# Valorant Competitive Match Prediction Using Machine Learning: Evidence from 1,300 Professional Matches

## Abstract

Professional esports competitions represent a unique challenge for predictive modeling—teams exhibit inconsistent performance patterns, meta shifts disrupt established hierarchies, and individual player variance introduces substantial noise. Nevertheless, I developed a machine learning approach achieving 60.5% accuracy in predicting Valorant match outcomes across 1,300 professional matches (2021-2025). While this might seem modest, it represents an 8.5 percentage point improvement over random prediction. More intriguing, however, is what the model revealed about competitive gaming evolution: mature esports scenes demonstrate increasing predictability over time, suggesting stabilization of competitive dynamics. 
Through systematic feature engineering, specifically the identification of a 20-day optimal performance window, I uncovered patterns in how team skill differentials, historical dominance, momentum effects, and head-to-head records not only combine but also compound in order to give us a better prediction of match results.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

The intersection of machine learning and esports analytics presents both tremendous opportunities and significant challenges. Unlike traditional sports, where decades of data and established metrics exist, competitive gaming operates in a constantly evolving environment. Patches alter game balance bi-weekly; rosters change mid-season; entirely new strategies emerge overnight. This volatility makes prediction particularly difficult, yet also particularly valuable, and an interesting challenge. 

This project addresses a straightforward question: Is it possible to predict professional Valorant match outcomes with meaningful accuracy?

The project consisted of analyzing 1,300 professional Valorant matches from major VCT (Valorant Champions Tour) events spanning November 2021 to July 2025. The resulting model achieves 60.5% test accuracy, which, while not revolutionary, proves sufficient for practical applications. Perhaps more importantly, the modeling process uncovered several phenomena: (1) a consistent 20-day window for optimal performance assessment, (2) evidence that competitive scenes become more predictable as they mature, (3) synergistic effects between predictive features that amplify accuracy when aligned, and (4) a minimum threshold of two previous encounters for head-to-head data to become meaningful.

## 2. Related Work and Context

Previous attempts at esports prediction have largely focused on more established titles. Chen et al. (2021) achieved 58% accuracy predicting League of Legends matches using neural networks, though their approach required extensive feature engineering specific to that game's mechanics. Similarly, Rodriguez and Kumar (2022) demonstrated 62% accuracy for CS: GO predictions but relied heavily on map-specific models that don't translate well to Valorant's agent-based system.

The challenge with Valorant specifically lies in its relative youth—launched in 2020, the competitive scene lacks the historical depth of older esports. Additionally, the game's emphasis on agent compositions and ability usage creates a more complex prediction space than purely aim-based shooters. My approach sidesteps these complications by focusing more on recent team performance metrics and general predictive trends such as recent form or head-to-head matchups history.

## 3. Data Collection and Preprocessing

### 3.1 Dataset Construction

The dataset encompasses ~1,300 professional matches from tier-1 VCT tournaments. I deliberately excluded lower-tier competitions due to inconsistent data quality and the higher variance in semi-professional play. Each match record contains:

- Individual player R2 (Rating 2.0 Score) ratings (more info here: https://www.vlr.gg/381456/vlr-rating-2-0-update)
- Round scores for each map
- Map names
- Match dates and tournament contexts  
- Team rosters and opponent information

Initial data collection yielded close to 2,000 matches, but many were removed due to incomplete information or data anomalies (e.g., forfeits recorded as 13-0 victories, lack of R2 score available, missing player data).

Since Riot Games was not kind enough to provide their API for research, data collection was done using a custom web scraper utilizing Selenium and a painful amount of regular expressions (see src/scrape_vlr). 

### 3.2 Data Quality Challenges

Several issues complicated data preparation. Team names weren't standardized across tournaments and time periods; "JDG Esports" might appear as "JDG", or "Natus Vincere" being referred to as "NAVI", depending on the time period of the match, or the tournament. I developed a mapping dictionary to resolve these inconsistencies, though some edge cases required manual intervention.

Due to the top 43 VLR teams regularly matching up against each other, there were many duplicate scrapes that had to be cleaned, such as a player counter of 20 for a single match when the maximum is typically 10.

Player substitutions posed another challenge. When teams used stand-ins, R2 ratings could vary dramatically from typical performance. I chose to retain these matches rather than exclude them, reasoning that substitutions are part of the competitive reality that models should account for.

## 4. Feature Engineering Approach

### 4.1 Core Features

The model relies on four engineered features, each capturing different aspects of competitive performance:

**Team Skill Advantage** (`r2_advantage`): The difference between teams' 20-day rolling average ratings. This captures fundamental skill differentials while accounting for recent form. Interestingly, shorter windows (7-10 days) proved too volatile, while longer windows (30+ days) failed to capture legitimate performance shifts.

**Historical Round Dominance** (`rolling_round_diff`): A team's average round differential over the past 20 days. Teams that consistently win 13-5 differ meaningfully from those grinding out 13-11 victories, even if win rates are similar. This feature captures those tendencies.

**Recent Momentum** (`recent_form`): Win percentage over the last 5 matches within a 30-day window. The constraint prevents stale data from influencing predictions—a 5-0 run two months ago means little for today's match.

**Head-to-Head Record** (`h2h_advantage`): Historical win rate against the specific opponent. Through experimentation, it's determined that at least two previous encounters are necessary for this feature to provide a signal rather than noise.

### 4.2 Feature Engineering Decisions

Why these four features specifically? Experimenting with numerous alternatives, such as individual player ratings, player consistency, and map-specific performance, found diminishing returns beyond the core set. Adding more features rarely improved training accuracy and hurt generalization, suggesting overfitting.

The 20-day window emerged through systematic testing rather than theoretical reasoning. I evaluated windows from 7 to 60 days in increments of 5-10 days, finding a clear optimum around 20. This likely reflects the timeframe relevant to Valorant's specific team consistency and predictive power. 

## 5. Model Development and Validation

### 5.1 Algorithm Selection

#Logistic regression with L2 regularization, for several reasons:

1. **Interpretability**: Unlike neural networks, it's possible to examine feature coefficients to understand what drives predictions
2. **Sample efficiency**: Given the sample size, there is sufficient data for robust estimation
3. **Generalization**: Simple models often outperform complex ones on smaller datasets

### 5.2 Temporal Validation Strategy

Proper validation for time-series data requires careful attention to temporal ordering. An 80/20 chronological split was used, training on matches before April 2025 and testing on April-July 2025 matches. This mimics real-world deployment, where models predict future matches based on historical data.

To prevent data leakage, all rolling averages were calculated using `.shift(1)` operations, ensuring predictions never incorporated information from the match being predicted. This seemingly minor detail is crucial—without it, accuracy can be artificially inflated by more than 30 percentage points.

### 5.3 Cross-Validation and Stability Testing

Beyond the primary train/test split, the following was employed:

- **5-fold time-series cross-validation**: Maintaining temporal ordering within each fold
- **Bootstrap sampling**: 1000 iterations to assess coefficient stability
- **Feature ablation**: Systematically removing features to verify each contributes meaningfully

These validation approaches confirmed model stability—accuracy varied by only ±1.7% across different validation sets.

## 6. Results and Analysis

### 6.1 Quantitative Performance

The model achieved 60.5% accuracy on the held-out test set (261 matches from April-July 2025), compared to 55.7% on the training set (1,037 matches from 2021-March 2025). This improvement on test data initially seemed suspicious, but investigation revealed two possible explanations.

1. The Valorant Competitive has become more predictable over time, considering the test data is the most recent data.
2. The test data set did not have enough data points in order to output a reliable result 

Individual feature performance:
- Team skill advantage alone: 55.2% accuracy
- Historical dominance: 56.7%  
- Recent momentum: 54.4%
- Head-to-head records: 53.6%

Combined model: 60.5%

The super-additive combination suggests that features capture complementary information. When features align (e.g., skill advantage + momentum + favorable head-to-head), prediction confidence increases dramatically.

### 6.2 Temporal Evolution of Predictability

Analyzing accuracy by year reveals a clear trend:
- 2021-2022: 53.8% accuracy
- 2023: 56.2% accuracy  
- 2024: 58.1% accuracy
- 2025 (partial): 60.5% accuracy

This increasing predictability likely reflects competitive maturation. Early in a game's lifespan, strategies are unrefined, the meta shifts rapidly, and upset potential is high. As scenes mature, hierarchies stabilize, optimal strategies crystallize, and favorites more consistently defeat underdogs.

### 6.3 Feature Importance Analysis

Logistic regression coefficients (standardized) provide insight into relative feature importance:

```
r2_advantage:      0.743
rolling_round_diff: 0.521
recent_form:        0.398
h2h_advantage:      0.265
```

Team skill remains the dominant predictor, though historical dominance patterns contribute substantially. Head-to-head records, while least influential overall, can be decisive in rivalry matches where teams have an extensive history.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 The 20-Day Window Finding

It was revealed that most features rolling values excelled most at the 20-day window, which can reveal more than just a statistical artifact: 

1. **Patch cycles**: Major updates typically occur every 2-3 weeks, making 20 days capture one full meta iteration
2. **Scrim schedules**: Teams often practice in 2-3 week blocks between tournaments
3. **Psychological factors**: Performance streaks lasting beyond 20 days might indicate genuine skill changes rather than temporary variance

Whatever the underlying cause, this finding has interesting implications for teams and analysts. Performance assessments should weigh recent results heavily but not myopically; the past three weeks matter most.

### 7.2 Competitive Scene Maturation
The increasing predictability over time contradicts common assumptions about esports' chaotic unpredictability. While individual matches remain in the air, aggregate patterns are strengthening through time. This mirrors traditional sports' historical development, but rather than decades, it is compressed into 4-5 years.


## 8. Practical Applications
Beyond academic interest, this model has concrete applications:

**Tournament seeding**: Organizers can use predictions to create balanced brackets and avoid early matchups between likely finalists.

**Broadcast production**: Networks can allocate resources to probable close matches while scheduling likely stomps during off-peak hours.

**Team preparation**: Coaches can identify which opponents pose genuine threats versus those where experimental strategies might be tested.

**Betting market analysis**: While this model was developed for analytical purposes and is not intended for gambling applications, it could theoretically inform market efficiency studies or academic research into prediction accuracy in esports betting markets.

## 9. Conclusion

This work demonstrates that professional Valorant matches can be predicted with modest but meaningful accuracy using straightforward machine learning techniques. The 60.5% accuracy achieved, while not groundbreaking, exceeds random chance sufficiently to enable practical applications.

More significantly, the research reveals insights about competitive gaming itself: the existence of optimal temporal windows for performance assessment, evidence of scene maturation through increasing predictability, and synergistic effects between different performance dimensions. These findings extend beyond Valorant, suggesting general principles that might apply across esports.

The simplicity of our approach—four interpretable features, logistic regression, careful temporal validation—makes it accessible to practitioners without extensive machine learning expertise. Sometimes, simple models carefully applied trump complex architectures hastily deployed.

Future research should test whether the 20-day window generalizes to other esports, investigate causal mechanisms behind increasing predictability, and explore real-time prediction systems that update during matches. As esports continues growing, rigorous analytical approaches will become increasingly valuable for teams, organizers, and broadcasters alike.
