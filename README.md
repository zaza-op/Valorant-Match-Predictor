## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset consists of 1,300 professional Valorant matches from major VCT tournaments between November 2021 and July 2025, covering 43 tier-1 competitive teams. Each match record includes:
- Individual player performance ratings (R2 Score-based metrics)
- Map-by-map scores and outcomes
- Tournament context and dates
- Team compositions and opponent information

Data quality assurance included removal of incomplete matches, validation of team abbreviations, and temporal consistency checks.

### Feature Engineering

The model employs four predictive features:

#### 1. Team Skill Advantage (R2_advantage)
```python
r2_advantage = rolling_20d_my_rating - rolling_20d_opponent_rating
```
Quantifies the skill differential between teams using 20-day rolling averages of individual player R2 ratings, #R2 stands for the Rating 2.0 score VLR.gg calculates and uses for players, similar to KDA, but more complex. This feature captures fundamental team strength while accounting for recent form fluctuations.

#### 2. Historical Round Dominance (rolling_round_diff)
```python
rolling_round_diff = rolling_average(our_total_rounds - their_total_rounds, 20_days)
```
Measures each team's historical tendency to win matches by large or small margins. Positive values indicate teams that typically dominate opponents, while negative values suggest teams that struggle or play close matches.

#### 3. Recent Momentum (recent_form)
```python
recent_form = win_rate_last_5_matches_within_30_days
```
Captures short-term team momentum by calculating win percentage over the most recent 5 matches within a 30-day window. This feature accounts for psychological factors, meta adaptation, and roster chemistry effects.

#### 4. Head-to-Head Historical Advantage (h2h_advantage)
```python
h2h_advantage = historical_win_rate_vs_specific_opponent (minimum 2 previous matches)
```
Quantifies matchup-specific advantages based on direct historical competition between teams. Defaults to neutral (0.5) for insufficient match history, with empirically determined minimum threshold of 2 previous encounters.

### Model Architecture and Validation

**Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
**Rationale**: Provides interpretable coefficients while maintaining strong predictive performance for the available sample size (1,300 matches ÷ 4 features = 325 samples per parameter).

**Temporal Validation Strategy**:
- 80/20 chronological split: Training on matches before April 2025, testing on April-July 2025
- No data leakage: All rolling averages calculated using only historical data via `.shift(1)` operations
- Cross-validation: 5-fold time-series cross-validation confirms model stability

**Comprehensive Validation Suite**:
- Individual feature predictive power analysis
- Bootstrap sampling for model stability assessment
- Random baseline comparison (model shows 8.5% improvement over chance)
- Feature importance and coefficient interpretation

## Key Findings and Research Insights

### 1. Temporal Window Optimization
Through systematic experimentation, 20-day rolling windows proved optimal for Valorant prediction across all features. This finding suggests:
- **Sufficient context**: Captures enough match history for stable performance estimates
- **Optimal recency**: Balances historical context with current meta relevance
- **Meta stability**: Aligns with typical patch cycles and strategic adaptation periods in competitive Valorant

### 2. Esports Competitive Evolution
The model demonstrates significantly better performance on recent matches (2025) compared to historical data (2021-2024):
- **Training data (2021-2024)**: 55.7% accuracy
- **Test data (2025)**: 60.5% accuracy
- **Interpretation**: Mature competitive scenes develop more predictable patterns as team hierarchies stabilize and strategic depth increases, furthermore, the abundance of h2h matches may have contributed. It's also possible that due to limited test data set (about 300 matches), predictive power decreased. 

### 3. Feature Synergy Effect
Individual features show modest predictive power (52-57% accuracy), but combined performance reaches 60.5%. This suggests:
- **Non-linear interactions**: Features become exponentially more powerful when they align
- **Confidence amplification**: Multiple confirming signals create high-confidence predictions
- **Competitive dynamics**: Teams with advantages across multiple dimensions (skill, momentum, matchup history) become highly likely to win

Statistical analysis reveals:
```
Individual Feature Performance:
- R2_advantage: 55.2% (skill differential)
- rolling_round_diff: 56.7% (dominance patterns)
- recent_form: 54.4% (momentum)
- h2h_advantage: 53.6% (matchup history)

Combined Model: 60.5% (demonstrating positive feature interaction)
```

### 4. Head-to-Head Optimization
Empirical testing revealed that requiring minimum 2 previous matches for H2H calculations optimizes performance:
- **Single matches**: Too noisy for reliable pattern detection
- **2+ matches**: Begin to establish meaningful competitive relationships
- **Result**: 59.8% → 60.5% accuracy improvement through threshold adjustment

X_train = train_data[['R2_advantage', 'rolling_round_diff', 
                     'recent_form', 'h2h_advantage']]
y_train = (train_data['result'] == 'W').astype(int)

# Model training with cross-validation
